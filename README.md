This app is a simple weather app. 
The app utilizes an API to display the following information: Current temperature, min temp, max temp, sunrise, sunset, pressure, humidity and cloduiness.
Using it is as easy as typing the name of a city into the search bar and clicking the search button. 
You can also change the units of measurement from imperial to metric using the "C|F" button. 
We also added a light/dark mode feature into the application, this can be toggled using the "theme" toggle.
We illustrate multiple ideas in our Kotlin code, some of which include: AsyncTasks, Polymorphism, Higher-order and lambda functions.
